** IMPACT requires glFinish() to wrap call to glTexImage2D()
   -- bug of IMPACT ??

               glprim.l:
	       ;; -*- NOTE -*- 
	       ;; the following pair of (glfinish) surrounding
	       ;; glTexImage2D is needed
	       ;; it causes IMPACT graphics subsystems to HANG on some occasion.
	       ;; (maybe a bug of IMPACT.)
	       ;; also when there is multiple programs doing this call,
	       ;; it seems that also has to be mut-excluded.
	       ;; -- kenji konaka
	       (glFinish)
	       (glTexImage2D GL_TEXTURE_2D 
	       ...)
