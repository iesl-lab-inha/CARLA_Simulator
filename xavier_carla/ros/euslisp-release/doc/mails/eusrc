EusLisp change notice		July/10/1989

(1) .eusrc
When eus begins execution, it always tries to load ~/.eusrc.
User specific initialization procedures like setting *prompt-string*
or creating windows, can be programmed in this file. Euscomp also loads
this file before the compilation. No errors are allowed to occur during
the load of this file.

(2) *load-path*
New load searches for a file in the directories listed in *load-path*.
The default path is ("./" "/usr/local/eus/llib/" "/usr/local/eus/demo/"),
and (load "x") is sufficient to load "/usr/local/eus/demo/x.l".
However this default is temporal, and it would be better to explicitly
set this variable in .eusrc file.
Note that slash(/) is necessary for each entry in *path-list* to
indicate it is a directory.

These changes are available only in ETL.
