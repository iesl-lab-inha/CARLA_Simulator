Source files of the euslisp reference manual are located
in oc/latex. The toplevel file is manual.tex, which inputs
other *.tex files describing individual sections.

If you wish to add a new section, name it ???.tex and refer
the file somewhere in the input lines in the end of manual.tex.
The file should begin with \section{section-name}. A section
may have any number of subsections or subsubsections.
Section titles of \section through \subsection are listed in
the table-of-contents.

To add a general description in a section, just put it after
the section header. Descriptions about functions, macros, 
classes, methods, and variables must appear in \refdesc environment.
A typical section with a bunch of function description appears
as follows:

\section{New Feature}
\markright{\arabic{section}. New Feature}

Here is a general description about a new feature.
...
\begin{refdesc}
\funcdesc{funcname}{arg1 arg2 ...}{this function computes ....}
\macrodesc{macroname}{arg1 arg2 ...}{{\em arg1} and {\em arg2} are ...}
\methoddesc{methodname}{arg ...}{ ...}
\end{refdesc}

In each description, arguments should be referred by italic word,
keywords and functions by bold or tt font.
