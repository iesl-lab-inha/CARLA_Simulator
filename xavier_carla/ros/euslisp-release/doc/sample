Here is a simple explanation how to use my EusLisp and its solid modeler.

--------------------------------
How to run EusLisp:

1. Set DISPLAY environment variable to your xserver.

   % setenv DISPLAY grebe:0.0

   Be sure that the machine your are running EusLisp is authorized
   to connect to your xserver. If not, add the machine to the xhost list.

2. Run EusLisp by name of eusx.
   All the EusLisp files are located in flamingo:/u2/geom/matsui/eus,
   and Executables under eus/bin. Among several executables, bin/eusx,
   which has Xlib interface, is the one you should run.

   % cd /u2/geom/matsui/eus
   % bin/eusx

   Then you will see a message like below:
	connected to Xserver DISPLAY=aslap:0
	EusLisp 7.13 with Xlib created on Tue Sep 24 12:58:38 1991

   The toplevel of "eusx" interprets both lisp expressions and unix commands.
   No shell escape is required. Try, say, "ls" or "pwd". The toplevel
   also automatically provides outhermost parenthesises. You may type
   "list 'a 'b" instead of "(list 'a 'b)".

3. How to create 3D objects and display them
   eus$ (load "demo/view")   ; will open a graphics window.
   eus$ (setq a (make-cube 500 400 300))
   eus$ (draw a)	;draw the cube
   eus$ (setq b (make-cylinder 100 400))
   eus$ (draw b)
   eus$ (setq a+b (body+ a b))	;union of two objects
   eus$ (cls)		;clear the graphics window
   eus$ (hid a+b)	;hidden-line eliminated drawing

   To see model engine parts, load "robot/enya/enyaview.l"

   eusx$ cd robot/enya
   eusx$ load "enyaview"

   It will take about one minute to read model structure defined
   in enya.Brep. 

   Eventually, all the engine parts will be drawn in the window.
   To get the hidden-line-eliminated image, type (cls) and (hid enyas).


The reference manual is available from me. It's about 130 pages.

-----------------------------------

I am very glad if you let me know how to run your assembly planner.
Which machine and which lisp should I use? I tried lucid on dabchick,
and loaded "grasp-init.cl" or "grasp-system.cl", but it was in vain.
