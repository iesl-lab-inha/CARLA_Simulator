(>= function-documentation "
Args: (number &rest more-numbers)
Returns T if the args are in non-increasing order; NIL otherwise.")

Args: (char &rest more-chars)
Returns T if the character codes of CHARs are in non-increasing order; NIL
otherwise.")
(fill-pointer function-documentation "
Args: (vector)
Returns the fill-pointer of VECTOR as an integer.  VECTOR must have a fill-
pointer.")
(long-float-negative-epsilon variable-documentation "
The smallest positive long-float E that satisfies
	(not (= (float 1 E) (- (float 1 E) E)))")
(macro-function function-documentation "
Args: (symbol)
Returns the expansion function of the global macro named SYMBOL.  Returns NIL
if no such macro exists.  The expansion function receives a macro form and an
environment, and returns the expanded form.")

A random-state object stores information used to generate random numbers.  A
random-state is notated as '#$' followed by a certain number.")

The smallest positive short-float E that satisfies

Args: (string1 string2

number of characters in the longest common prefix of the strings.")

(top-level function-documentation "
Args: ()
KCL specific.
The top-level loop of KCL.
When KCL is invoked, it evaluates (FUNCALL 'SI:TOP-LEVEL).  To change the top-
level of KCL, redefine SI:TOP-LEVEL and save the core image into a program
file.  When the saved image is invoked, it will start the redefined top-level.")
