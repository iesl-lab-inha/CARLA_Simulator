(char-control-bit variable-documentation "
The bit position indicating a control character.  0 in KCL.")
(deftype function-documentation "
Syntax: (deftype name lambda-list {decl | doc}* {form}*)
Defines a new type-specifier abbreviation in terms of an 'expansion' function
	(lambda lambda-list1 {DECL}* {FORM}*)
where LAMBDA-LIST1 is identical to LAMBDA-LIST except that all optional
parameters with no default value specified in LAMBDA-LIST defaults to the
symbol '*', but not to NIL.  When the type system of KCL encounters a type
specifier (NAME arg1 ... argn), it calls the expansion function with the
arguments ARG1 ... ARGn, and uses the returned value instead of the original
type specifier.  When the symbol NAME is used as a type specifier, the
expansion function is called with no argument.
The doc-string DOC, if supplied, is saved as a TYPE doc and can be retrieved
by (documentation 'NAME 'type).")
(export function-documentation "
Args: (symbol &optional (package *package*))
Register SYMBOL as an external symbol of PACKAGE.  SYMBOL may be a list of
symbols.")
(isqrt function-documentation "
Args: (integer)
Returns the integer square root of INTEGER.")
(ratio type-documentation "
A ratio is notated by its numerator and denominator, separated by a slash '/'.
Normally, a ratio is notated in radix 10 (see *PRINT-BASE* and *READ-BASE*) as
	[sign] {digit}+ / {digit}+
where DIGIT is a decimal digit ('0', ..., '9') and SIGN is either '+' or '-'.
Also, the following syntax is used to notate the radix explicitly.
	# radix {r | R} [sign] {digit}+ / {digit}+
where RADIX is one of '2', '3', ..., '36' and DIGIT is a digit in radix RADIX:
	Digits in radix 2 are '0' and '1'
	Digits in radix 8 are '0', ..., '7'
	Digits in radix 16 are '0', ..., '9', 'a', ..., 'f', and 'A', ..., 'F'
The following syntax is also available for radix 2, 8, 10, and 16.
	# {b | B} [sign] {digit}+ / {digit}+
	# {o | O} [sign] {digit}+ / {digit}+
	# {x | X} [sign] {digit}+ / {digit}+")
(sort function-documentation "
Args: (sequence test &key (key #'identity))
Destructively sorts SEQUENCE and returns the result.  TEST should return non-
NIL if its first argument is to precede its second argument.  The order of two
elements X and Y is arbitrary if both
	(FUNCALL TEST X Y)
	(FUNCALL TEST Y X)
evaluates to NIL.  See STABLE-SORT.")
(sqrt function-documentation "
Args: (number)
Returns the square root of the arg.")
(user-homedir-pathname function-documentation "
Args: (&optional host)
Returns a pathname the represents the user's home directory.  HOST is simply
ignored in KCL.")
(set-hole-size function-documentation "
Args: (fixnum)
KCL specific.
Sets the size of the memory hole (in pages).")
