(float-radix function-documentation "
Args: (float)
Returns the base number used in the representation of FLOAT.")
(*ignore-maximum-pages* variable-documentation "
KCL specific.
Tells the KCL memory manager whether (non-NIL) or not (NIL) it should expand
memory when the maximum allocatable pages have been used up.  The initial
value is T.")
(let function-documentation "
Syntax: (let ({var | (var [init])}*) {decl}* {form}*)
Evaluates all INITs (which defaults to NIL), binds the value of each INIT to
the corresponding VAR, evaluates FORMs, and returns all values of the last
FORM.  Returns NIL if no FORM is given.")
(long-float-epsilon variable-documentation "
The smallest positive long-float E that satisfies
	(not (= (float 1 E) (+ (float 1 E) E)))")
(not function-documentation "
Args: (x)
Returns T if X is NIL; NIL otherwise.")
(pathname type-documentation "
A pathname object identifies an external file or a collection of external
files.  A pathname object consists of six slots, HOST, DEVICE, DIRECTORY,
NAME, and TYPE.  HOST, DEVICE, and VERSION slots are meaningless in KCL,
though they are harmless at all.
A pathname is notated as #\\\"...\", where '...' is actually some information
on the pathname.  This depends on the version of KCL.  Refer to the KCL Report
for details.")
(pathname function-documentation "
Args: (filespec)
Returns a pathname specified by FILESPEC.  FILESPEC may be a symbol, a string,
a pathname, or a file stream.")
(prog1 function-documentation "
Syntax: (prog1 first-form {form}*)
Evaluates FIRST-FORM and FORMs in order.  Returns the value of FIRST-FORM.")
(reduce function-documentation "
Args: (function sequence
       &key (from-end nil) (start 0) (end (length sequence)) initial-value)
Combines all the elements of SEQUENCE using the binary operation FUNCTION.")
(require function-documentation "
Args: (module-name &optional pathname)
If the specified module name is not found in *MODULES*, then loads the files
specified by PATHNAME.  Otherwise, does nothing.  MODULE-NAME may be a string
or a symbol.  If it is a symbol, the print name of the symbol is used as the
module name.  PATHNAME may be a pathname object or it may be a list of
pathname objects.  If PATHNAME is not given, then KCL tries to load the file
whose file name is MODULE-NAME and whose filetype is either .FASL, .LSP, or
none.  See PROVIDE.")
(some function-documentation "
Args: (predicate sequence &rest more-sequences)
Returns T if at least one of the elements in SEQUENCEs satisfies PREDICATE;
NIL otherwise.")
(*standard-output* variable-documentation "
The default output stream used by the KCL printer.  The initial value is a
synonym stream to *TERMINAL-IO*.")
(the function-documentation "
Syntax: (the type form)
Declares that FORM evaluates to a value of TYPE.  Evaluates FORM and checks if
the value belongs to TYPE.  If it does, returns the value.  Otherwise, signals
an error.")
(trace function-documentation "
Syntax: (trace {function-name}*)
Begins tracing the specified functions.  With no FUNCTION-NAMEs, returns a
list of functions currently being traced.")
(error-set function-documentation "
Args: (form)
KCL specific.
Evaluates the FORM in the null environment.  If the evaluation is successfully
completed, SI:ERROR-SET returns NIL as the first value and the results of the
evaluation as the rest of the values.  If, in the course of the evaluation, a
non-local jump from the FORM is attempted, SI:ERROR-SET traps the jump and
returns the corresponding jump tag as its value.")
(*indent-formatted-output* variable-documentation "
KCL specific.
The FORMAT directive ~% indents the next line, if the value of this variable
is non-NIL.  If NIL, ~% simply does Newline.")
