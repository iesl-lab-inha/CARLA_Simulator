(parse-namestring function-documentation "
Args: (string &optional host defaults &key (start 0) end (junk-allowed nil))
Parses STRING and returns a pathname.  As the second value, returns the index
to the character next to the last character that has been parsed.  STRING is
usually a string object but it may be a symbol, a pathname, or a file stream.
START and END are meaningful only when STRING is a string or a symbol.  They
default to 0 and (length (string FILESPEC)) respectively.  When the parsing is
failed, signals an error (if JUNK-ALLOWED is NIL) or simply returns NIL.  HOST
and DEFAULTS are simply ignored in KCL.")
