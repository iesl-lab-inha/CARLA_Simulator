<H2><A NAME="SECTION02031000000000000000">
Atoms</A>
</H2>

<P>
A data object other than a cons is always an atom, no matter what complex
structure it may have.
Note that NIL, which is sometimes noted as () to represent an empty
list, is also an atom.
Every atom except a symbol is always evaluated to itself,
although quoting is required in some other Common Lisp implementations.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02032000000000000000">
Scoping</A>
</H2>

<P>
Every symbol may have associated value.
A symbol is evaluated to its value determined in the current binding context.
There are two kinds of variable bindings;
the lexical or static binding and the special or dynamic binding.
Lexically bound variables are introduced by <B>lambda</B> form or
<B>let</B> and <B>let*</B> special forms
unless they are declared special.
Lexical binding can be nested and the only one binding which is introduced
innermost level is visible, hiding outer lexical bindings and the special 
binding.
Special variables are used in two ways:
one is for global variables, and the other is for dynamically scoped
local variables which are visible even at the outside of
the lexical scope as long as the binding is in effect.
In the latter case, special variables are needed to be declared special.
The declaration is recognized not only by the compiler, but also by
the interpreter.
According to the Common Lisp's terms, special variables are said to have
indefinite scope and dynamic extent.

<P>
Even if there exists a lexical variable in a certain scope,
the same variable name can be redeclared to be special in inner scope.
Function <B>symbol-value</B> can be used to retrieve  the special values
regardless to the lexical scopes.
Note that <B>set</B> function works only for special variable, i.e.
it cannot be used to change the value of lambda or let variables
unless they are declared special.

<P>
<PRE>
(let ((x 1))
   (declare (special x))
   (let* ((x (+ x x)) (y x))
      (let* ((y (+ y y)) (z (+ x x)))
         (declare (special x))
         (format t "x=~S y=~s z=~s~%" x y z) ) ) )
--&gt; x=1 y=4 z=2
</PRE>

<P>
A symbol can be declared to be a constant by <B>defconstant</B> macro.
Once declared, an attempt to change the value signals an error thereafter.
Moreover, such a constant symbol is inhibited to be used as
the name of a variable even for a local variable.
NIL and T are examples of such constants.
Symbols in the keyword package are always declared to be constants
when they are created.
In contrast, <B>defvar</B> and <B>defparameter</B> macro declare
symbols to be special variables.
<B>defvar</B> initializes the value only if the symbol is unbound,
and does nothing when it already has a value assigned,
while <B>defparameter</B> always resets the value.

<P>
When a symbol is referenced and there is no lexical binding for the symbol,
its special value is retrieved.
However, if no value has been assigned to its special value yet,
unbound variable error is signaled.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02033000000000000000">
Generalized Variables</A>
</H2>
Generally, any values or attributes are represented in slots of objects
(or in stack frames).
To retrieve and alter the value of a slot,
two primitive operations, <EM>access</EM> and <EM>update</EM>, must be provided.
Instead of defining two distinct primitives for every slot of objects,
EusLisp, like Common Lisp, provides uniform update operations
based on the generalized variable concept.
In this concept, a common form is recognized  either as a value access form
or as a slot location specifier.
Thus, you only need to remember accessing form for each slot and
update is achieved by <B>setf</B> macro used in conjunction with the access form.
For example, <TT>(car x)</TT> can be used to replace the value
in the car slot of <TT>x</TT> when used with <B>setf</B> as in <TT>(setf (car 
'(a b) 'c)</TT>,
as well as to take the car value out of the list.

<P>
This method is also applicable to all the user defined objects.
When a class or a structure is defined, the access and update forms
for each slot are automatically defined.
Each of those forms is defined as a macro whose name is the concatenation of
the class name and slot name.
For example, car of a cons can be addressed by <TT>(cons-car '(a b c))</TT>.

<P>

All the special forms are listed in Table <A HREF="#SpecialForms">2</A>.
<B>macrolet, compiler-let,</B> and <B>progv</B> have not been implemented.
Special forms are essential language constructs for the management of
evaluation contexts and control flows.
The interpreter and compiler have special knowledge to
process each of these constructs properly, while the application
method is uniform for all functions.
Users cannot add their own special form definition.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02035000000000000000">
Macros</A>
</H2>

<P>
Macro is a convenient method to expand language constructs.
When a macro is called, arguments are passed to the macro body,
which is a macro expansion function, without being evaluated.
Then, the macro expansion function expands the arguments,
and returns the new form.
The resulted form is then evaluated again outside the macro.
It is an error to apply a macro or special form to a list of arguments.
<B>Macroexpand</B> function can be used for the explicit macro expansion.

<P>
Though macro runs slowly when interpreted,
it speeds up compiled code execution,
because macro expansion is taken at compile-time only once
and no overhead is left to run-time.
Note that explicit call to eval or apply in the macro function may
produce different results between interpreted execution
and the compiled execution.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION02036000000000000000">
Functions</A>
</H2>

<P>
A function is expressed by a lambda form which is merely a list
whose first element is <B>lambda</B>.
If a lambda form is defined for a symbol using <B>defun</B>, it can be referred
as a global function name.
Lambda form takes following syntax.

<P><PRE><TT>
 (lambda ({var}* <BR>)}*] <BR>
<BR>) <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="9" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="manual-img5.png"
 ALT="$ \vert$"></SPAN> ((keyword var) [initform])}* <BR>] <BR>)}*]) 
<BR>  {declaration}* 
<BR>  {form}*) 
<BR>
</TT></PRE>
<P>
There is no function type such as EXPR, LEXPR, FEXPR, etc.:
arguments to a function are always evaluated before its application,
and the number of acceptable arguments is determined by lambda-list.
Lambda-list specifies the sequence of parameters to the lambda form.
Each of <B>&amp;optional, &amp;rest, &amp;key </B> and <B>&amp;aux</B> has special
meaning in lambda-lists, and these symbols cannot be used as variable
names.
Supplied-p variables for &amp;optional or &amp;key parameters are not supported.

<P>
Since a lambda form is indistinguishable from normal list data,
<B>function</B> special form must be used to inform the interpreter and
compiler the form is intended to be a function.
<A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="manual-footnode.html#foot968"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A><B>Function</B> is also important to freeze the environment onto the function,
so that all the lexical variables can be accessible in the function
even the function is passed to another function of different lexical scope.
The following program does not work either interpretedly nor after compiled,
since <TT>sum</TT> from the <TT>let</TT> is invisible  inside lambda form.

<P>
<PRE>
(let ((x '(1 2 3)) (sum 0))
  (mapc '(lambda (x) (setq sum (+ sum x))) x))
</PRE>

<P>
To get the expected result, it should be written as follows:
<PRE>
(let ((x '(1 2 3)) (sum 0))
   (mapc #'(lambda (x) (setq sum (+ sum x))) x ))
</PRE>

<P>
#' is the abbreviated notation of <B>function</B>,
i.e. <TT>#'(lambda (x) x)</TT> is equivalent to
<TT>(function (lambda (x) x))</TT>.
Here is another example of what is called a funarg problem:

<P>
<PRE>
(defun mapvector (f v)
    (do ((i 0 (1+ i)))
       ((&gt;= i (length v)))
       (funcall f (aref v i))))
(defun vector-sum (v)
    (let ((i 0))
       (mapvector #'(lambda (x) (setq i (+ i x))) v)
       i))
(vector-sum #(1 2 3 4)) --&gt; 10
</PRE>

<P>
EusLisp's closure cannot have indefinite extent:
i.e. a closure can only survive as long as its outer extent is in effect.
This means that a closure cannot be used for programming of ``generators".
The following program does not work.

<P>
<PRE>
(proclaim '(special gen))
(let ((index 0))
   (setq gen #'(lambda () (setq index (1+ index)))))
(funcall gen)
</PRE>

<P>
However, the same purpose is accomplished by object oriented programming,
because an object can hold its own static variables:
<PRE>
(defclass generator object (index))
(defmethod generator
 (:next () (setq index (1+ index)))
 (:init (&amp;optional (start 0)) (setq index start) self))
(defvar gen (instance generator :init 0))
(send gen :next)
</PRE>
