				Electrotechnical Laboratory

* OpenGL and Mesa interface
	eusgl can use both opengl libraries and euslisp original X toolkits
	at the same time. A good example can be seen in lib/demo/tss96.l.
	To see this demo, load "lib/demo/tss96.l", (tss), and (demo).
	Note that you need to install Mesa if you run eusgl on non-SGI
	machines. 

	Mesa does not allow holes in a face. Triangulation program is
	available from Hara.

* VRML
	Brep representaion of bodies are converted to VRML format.

* Xwindow toolkit
	Cleaner and more efficient toolkit is provided. tss96.l is also
	a good example for modern Xtoolkit usage.

* Inclusion of 2d polygon modules
	Face+ and face- are available.

* Faceset
	The body class has the faceset class as its superclass.
	This structure is analogous to SGI and VRML.

* Compiler
	Car, cdr, etc., are compiled in-line for faster list manipulation.

* Multi platforms
	EusLisp is available on SunOS4, SunOS5, Alpha/OSF1, SGI, Linux
	and Win95.

* Bug fixes
	Reading very long strings, GC during addmethod, signals to threads
	are fixed.

* Libraries
	Geometric functions are stored in libeusgeo.so to avoid explosion
	of the global offset table.

* Contributions
	Hirukawa's contact analyzer is available.
