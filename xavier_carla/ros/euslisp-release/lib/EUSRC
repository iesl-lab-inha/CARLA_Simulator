;; Sample of an .eusrc file.
;; Copy this file to your home directory and customize as you like.

;; When EusLisp starts, it first tries to locate the eusrc file
;; named by 'EUSRC' environment variable.  If it is found, the  file
;; is loaded.  Otherwise, '.eusrc' file in the user's home directory
;; is loaded.
;; Also, if there is a .eusrc file in the current working directory,
;; it is loaded.  Note that if eus starts in the user's home directory,
;; .eusrc file is loaded twice.
